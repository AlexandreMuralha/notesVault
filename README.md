# notesVault ðŸ“–

This repository stores my study/tech notes. Some are in english, some in portuguese.

Usually I edit/search this repo using [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) with [obsidian git](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git) plugin or [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

You can browse the notes using the directories or use [index.md](index.md) file as an entry point.

- Each diretory contains an index file that lists all notes inside it. 
- The repo contains an [main index](index.md), that can be used as an entry point, that lists all index files from each of the directories.
- Both the main index and all individual directory indexes are generated by a python [script](create_index_all_dir.py) that I made.
